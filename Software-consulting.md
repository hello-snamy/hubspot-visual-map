Perfect — for a **software consulting / development / customization company**, the one-page HubSpot map shifts in *important* ways. You’re not selling a simple SKU; you’re selling **expertise, projects, time, and long-term relationships**.

I’ll explain the same one-page map, but **reframed exactly for a services / dev consultancy**.

---

## The Consulting Reality (Why HubSpot Must Be Different)

A consulting company sells:

* Discovery before clarity
* Scope before certainty
* Relationships over transactions
* Ongoing work after “Closed Won”

So your HubSpot map must handle:

* Long pre-sales cycles
* Multiple stakeholders
* Variable deal sizes
* Post-sale delivery + change requests

---

## 1️⃣ Entry Points — How Consulting Leads Enter

**Top-left of the map**

Typical for consulting/dev shops:

### Inbound

* Website “Contact Us”
* “Request a Quote”
* “Book a Discovery Call”
* Technical blog / case studies
* Partner referrals

### Outbound

* Founder-led outreach
* Account-based prospecting
* Partner co-selling
* Conference leads

**Consulting-specific rule**

> Every lead must capture **problem type** early.

Custom properties you *must* have:

* Project type (custom dev, integration, migration, support)
* Tech stack (React, .NET, Salesforce, HubSpot, etc.)
* Budget range (soft)
* Urgency

---

## 2️⃣ Core CRM Objects — What Represents Reality

**Center-left**

### Contacts

* Individual stakeholders (CTO, PM, buyer)
* Often many per company

### Companies

* The *real* buying unit
* Holds:

  * Industry
  * Size
  * Tech stack
  * Contract type

### Deals (Most Important Object)

For consulting, **Deals ≠ revenue only**.

Deals represent:

* Discovery engagement
* Fixed-scope project
* Time & materials contract
* Retainer / support agreement

**Critical rule**

> One deal = one commercial agreement.

### Tickets (or Custom Objects)

Used for:

* Post-sale support
* Change requests
* Ongoing work tracking

---

## 3️⃣ Pipelines — Consulting-Grade Flow

**Center of the map**

### Sales / Pre-Sales Pipeline

Typical stages:

1. Lead In / Referral
2. Discovery Scheduled
3. Discovery Completed
4. Solution Design
5. Proposal Sent
6. Negotiation
7. Closed Won / Lost

**Automation triggers**

* After “Discovery Completed” → create tasks for solution architect
* Proposal Sent → reminder sequence

---

### Delivery Pipeline (Very Important)

This is where most consulting HubSpots fail.

Stages:

1. Contract Signed
2. Kickoff Scheduled
3. In Delivery
4. QA / Review
5. Delivered
6. Warranty / Hypercare
7. Closed (Delivery)

This pipeline is **not sales** — it’s **operations visibility**.

---

### Expansion / Retainer Pipeline

For:

* Change requests
* Upsells
* Ongoing monthly work

> Rule: Don’t mix new sales with expansions.

---

## 4️⃣ Sequences — Human Touch in Consulting

**Right side**

Sequences are softer and more consultative:

### Pre-Sales Sequences

* Discovery follow-ups
* “Here’s what we heard” recap
* Proposal nudges

### Post-Sale Sequences

* Kickoff prep
* Stakeholder alignment
* Feedback collection

**Rule**

> Never over-automate consulting relationships.

Every sequence should:

* Have manual steps
* Reference project context
* Stop on reply

---

## 5️⃣ Automation & Rules — Protecting Your Team

**Under the system**

### Lead Scoring (Consulting Style)

Score based on:

* Company size
* Budget signals
* Tech stack match
* Seniority of contact

Not:

* Page views alone

---

### Lifecycle Stages (Adjusted)

Subscriber
→ Lead
→ **Qualified Opportunity**
→ **Active Client**
→ **Past Client**
→ Evangelist / Partner

---

### Routing Rules

* Route by:

  * Industry
  * Tech stack
  * Geography
* Assign **solution architect early**, not at proposal time

---

### Deal Automation

* Stage change → auto-create:

  * Discovery notes doc
  * Scope checklist
  * Internal handoff tasks

---

## 6️⃣ Dashboards — What Consulting Leaders Need

**Right / bottom**

### Sales Dashboard

* Pipeline value by project type
* Win rate by tech stack
* Avg discovery → close time

### Delivery Dashboard

* Active projects
* Delivery stage aging
* Overdue milestones

### RevOps / Forecast Dashboard

* Booked vs delivered revenue
* Retainer MRR
* Capacity vs demand

### Client Health Dashboard

* Active tickets
* CSAT / NPS
* Expansion readiness

**Rule**

> If delivery isn’t visible, margins disappear.

---

## 7️⃣ The Full Consulting Loop (Plain English)

> A company raises their hand →
> We qualify the *problem* →
> Run discovery →
> Design a solution →
> Close a deal →
> Deliver the work →
> Support and expand →
> Measure health and profitability

That’s the **consulting lifecycle**, mapped cleanly into HubSpot.

---

## 8️⃣ Why This One-Page Map Is Critical for Consulting

Because consulting breaks when:

* Sales overpromises
* Delivery lacks context
* Expansion is accidental
* Leadership sees revenue but not effort

This map forces:

* Clean handoffs
* Shared visibility
* Fewer surprises

---

## 9️⃣ Common Mistakes Consulting Firms Make

❌ Using one pipeline for everything
❌ No delivery visibility in HubSpot
❌ No tech stack segmentation
❌ No post-sale automation
❌ Dashboards that only show closed deals

---

If you want, next I can:

* Turn this into **exact HubSpot pipeline stages**
* Design **custom objects for projects**
* Create a **delivery + sales handoff workflow**
* Map this to **Jira / GitHub / Linear integrations**
* Build a **GitHub Pages visual version** of *your* consulting system

Just tell me where you want to go deeper.
