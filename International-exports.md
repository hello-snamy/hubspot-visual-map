Love this use case — **international exports** is one of those businesses where HubSpot *only* works if the system is crystal-clear. I’ll explain the **complete one-page HubSpot map specifically for an international exports / trading company** (manufacturers, exporters, merchant traders, B2B cross-border sellers).

Think: **inquiry → compliance → quotation → shipment → payment → repeat orders**.

---

## The Export Business Reality (Why HubSpot Needs Structure)

Export companies deal with:

* Long, multi-step sales cycles
* Buyers across countries & time zones
* Heavy documentation & compliance
* Partial payments, LC, advance/credit terms
* Shipments after the “sale”

So your HubSpot map must connect **sales, logistics, finance, and compliance** — not just marketing.

## 1️⃣ Entry Points — How Export Leads Come In

**Top-left of the map**

### Inbound

* Website RFQ forms
* Trade portals (Alibaba, Indiamart, TradeIndia, Global Sources)
* Email inquiries
* LinkedIn outreach
* Trade fair scans

### Outbound

* Buyer list imports
* Distributor outreach
* Agent / broker referrals

**Export-critical data to capture immediately**

* Country
* Product category
* Quantity / MOQ
* Incoterms (if known)
* Payment preference (LC / TT / OA)

> Rule: If you don’t know the country + product, the lead is incomplete.

---

## 2️⃣ Core CRM Objects — Export System of Record

**Center-left**

### Contacts

* Buyers, procurement managers, import agents
* Multiple contacts per buyer company

### Companies (Very Important)

The *true* buyer is the **company**, not the person.

Key company properties:

* Country
* Import license status
* Currency
* Buyer type (distributor / retailer / OEM)

---

### Deals (The Export Transaction)

In exports, **Deals = shipments or orders**, not just “sales”.

One deal typically represents:

* One RFQ → quotation → shipment cycle
  *(Large buyers may have repeat deals)*

> Rule: One deal = one shipment or one order batch.

---

### Custom Objects (Strongly Recommended)

For exporters, HubSpot works best with:

* **Products / SKUs**
* **Shipments**
* **Documents** (optional)

These objects keep CRM from turning into Excel chaos.

---

## 3️⃣ Pipelines — How Export Work Moves

**Center of the map**

### Export Sales Pipeline

Typical stages:

1. New Inquiry
2. Qualified (Product + Country)
3. Quotation Sent
4. Sample / Approval (if needed)
5. Negotiation
6. Proforma Invoice Issued
7. Payment Secured
8. Closed Won / Lost

---

### Logistics / Shipment Pipeline

Starts after payment:

1. Production / Procurement
2. Quality Check
3. Packaging
4. Documentation Ready
5. Cargo Booked
6. Shipped
7. Delivered
8. Closed (Shipment)

---

### Finance / Compliance Pipeline (Optional but Powerful)

Used for:

* LC approval
* Export documentation checks
* Compliance sign-off

---

## 4️⃣ Sequences — Human Follow-Up Across Borders

**Right side**

Sequences guide exporters through *structured international follow-ups*.

### Sales Sequences

* RFQ acknowledgment
* Quotation follow-ups
* Sample feedback requests
* Negotiation nudges

### Post-Sale Sequences

* Shipping updates
* Document sharing
* Payment reminders
* Delivery confirmation

**Golden rule**

> Never automate without allowing manual override — exports are relationship-heavy.

---

## 5️⃣ Automation & Rules — Protecting Margins & Compliance

**Under everything**

### Lead Scoring (Export Style)

Score higher for:

* Valid import country
* MOQ-matching quantities
* Repeat buyers
* Clear payment terms

Lower score for:

* High-risk countries
* Unrealistic quantities
* No response

---

### Lifecycle Stages (Export-Specific)

Subscriber
→ Inquiry
→ Qualified Buyer
→ Active Order
→ **Shipped Customer**
→ Repeat Buyer
→ Strategic Account

---

### Routing Rules

* By product category
* By region / country
* By language
* By risk level

---

### Deal Automation

* Quotation Sent → reminder tasks
* Payment Received → auto-create shipment deal
* Shipment Shipped → notify finance + client

> Rule: Sales should never chase documents manually.

---

## 6️⃣ Dashboards — What Export Leaders Actually Need

**Right / bottom**

### Sales Dashboard

* RFQs by country
* Quote-to-order conversion
* Average deal value by product

### Operations / Logistics Dashboard

* Shipments in progress
* Delays by stage
* Pending documentation

### Finance Dashboard

* Payments pending
* LC status
* Revenue by currency

### Management Dashboard

* Country-wise revenue
* Repeat buyer rate
* Pipeline aging

---

## 7️⃣ The Full Export Loop (Plain English)

> A buyer sends an inquiry →
> We qualify country & product →
> Send quotation →
> Negotiate →
> Issue PI →
> Receive payment / LC →
> Prepare goods →
> Ship →
> Deliver →
> Collect balance →
> Repeat order

That’s the **entire export lifecycle**, cleanly mapped.

---

## 8️⃣ Why the One-Page Map Is Critical for Exporters

Exports fail when:

* RFQs are lost
* Documentation is delayed
* Payments are unclear
* Logistics lacks visibility
* Repeat buyers aren’t tracked

This map enforces:

* Clear handoffs
* Compliance discipline
* Cash-flow visibility
* Predictable repeat business

---

## 9️⃣ Common Export HubSpot Mistakes

❌ Treating exports like SaaS sales
❌ No shipment visibility
❌ No country-based routing
❌ Deals closed before payment
❌ CRM used as email inbox

---

## 10️⃣ Why This Still Fits on One Page

Because it’s still the same four layers:

1. Lead enters
2. Deal moves
3. Shipment happens
4. Results are measured

Exports look complex — the map makes them *manageable*.
