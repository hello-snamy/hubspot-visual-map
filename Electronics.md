Got it. For an **electronics company** (manufacturer, brand owner, distributor, or systems integrator), HubSpot has to manage **products, channels, long sales cycles, service, and repeat purchases**—all in one system.

Below is the **complete one-page HubSpot map explained specifically for an electronics company**.

Think: **lead → product fit → quotation → order → delivery → service → repeat / upgrade**.

---

## The Electronics Business Reality

Electronics companies deal with:

* Multiple product lines (SKUs, variants)
* B2B + B2C buyers
* Channel partners / distributors
* RFQs, specs, BOMs
* Warranty, AMC, service tickets

So HubSpot must connect **sales, distribution, service, and lifecycle management**, not just lead tracking.

---

## 1️⃣ Entry Points — How Leads & Orders Enter

**Top-left of the map**

### Inbound

* Product inquiry forms
* RFQ forms
* Distributor portals
* Website chat / WhatsApp
* Marketplace inquiries

### Outbound

* Channel partner outreach
* Enterprise account targeting
* Dealer onboarding campaigns

**Critical data to capture early**

* Product category
* Application / use case
* Quantity
* Buyer type (consumer, enterprise, distributor)
* Location / serviceability

> Rule: If product + application aren’t known, qualification isn’t done.

## 2️⃣ Core CRM Objects — Electronics System of Record

**Center-left**

### Contacts

* Engineers, procurement, installers, consumers
* Multiple stakeholders per deal

### Companies

* Enterprises, dealers, distributors, system integrators
* Holds credit terms, region, channel tier

---

### Deals (Orders / Projects)

In electronics:

* **Deals = orders, projects, or supply contracts**

Examples:

* Bulk product order
* OEM supply agreement
* System installation project

> Rule: One deal = one commercial agreement or project.

---

### Products (Critical Object)

Electronics HubSpot **must** use Products:

* SKU
* Variant
* Warranty period
* Service SLA

Without Products, reporting collapses.

---

### Tickets (After-Sales Backbone)

Used for:

* Installation
* Warranty claims
* Repairs / RMAs
* AMC / service contracts

---

## 3️⃣ Pipelines — How Work Actually Moves

**Center of the map**

### Sales / RFQ Pipeline

Typical stages:

1. New Inquiry
2. Qualified (Product + Use Case)
3. Technical Evaluation
4. Quotation Sent
5. Negotiation
6. PO Received
7. Closed Won / Lost

---

### Channel / Dealer Pipeline

Used for:

* Dealer onboarding
* Tier upgrades
* Annual targets

---

### Service / Warranty Pipeline (Tickets)

Stages:

1. New Service Request
2. Diagnosis
3. Repair / Replacement
4. Resolved
5. Closed

> Rule: Service must be as visible as sales.

---

## 4️⃣ Sequences — Human Touch Where It Matters

**Right side**

### Pre-Sales Sequences

* RFQ acknowledgment
* Spec clarification
* Demo / sample follow-ups

### Post-Sale Sequences

* Installation check-ins
* Warranty reminders
* Upgrade / replacement nudges

**Golden rule**

> Automate the follow-up, not the relationship.

---

## 5️⃣ Automation & Rules — Controlling Complexity

**Under everything**

### Lead Scoring (Electronics-Style)

Score higher for:

* Enterprise buyers
* High-volume orders
* Approved industries
* Repeat customers

Lower score for:

* Low-value consumer noise (if B2B-focused)

---

### Lifecycle Stages (Adjusted)

Subscriber
→ Lead
→ Qualified Opportunity
→ **Customer**
→ Active Warranty
→ Support Customer
→ Repeat Buyer / Partner

---

### Routing Rules

* By product category
* By region
* By channel (direct vs dealer)
* By technical complexity

---

### Deal Automation

* Deal won → auto-create installation ticket
* Warranty start date set automatically
* AMC renewal reminders triggered

> Rule: Sales handoff to service must be automatic.

---

## 6️⃣ Dashboards — What Electronics Leaders Need

**Right / bottom**

### Sales Dashboard

* Pipeline by product category
* Win rate by channel
* Average deal size

### Channel Dashboard

* Dealer performance
* Order volume per partner
* Target vs actual

### Service Dashboard

* Open tickets
* SLA adherence
* Warranty claims by product

### Management Dashboard

* Revenue by product line
* Repeat purchase rate
* Service cost vs revenue

---

## 7️⃣ The Full Electronics Loop (Plain English)

> A buyer inquires →
> Product & use case are qualified →
> Technical evaluation →
> Quote →
> Order →
> Delivery →
> Installation / warranty →
> Service & upgrades →
> Repeat orders

That’s the **electronics lifecycle**, end-to-end.

## 8️⃣ Why the One-Page Map Is Critical in Electronics

Electronics companies fail when:

* Sales sells the wrong product
* Service lacks context
* Warranty isn’t tracked
* Dealers aren’t managed
* Upgrades are missed

The map enforces:

* Clean handoffs
* Product visibility
* Service accountability
* Long-term customer value

---

## 9️⃣ Common Electronics HubSpot Mistakes

❌ Not using Products object
❌ Mixing consumer & enterprise pipelines
❌ No warranty automation
❌ Service data outside CRM
❌ Dashboards focused only on sales

---

## 10️⃣ Why This Still Fits on One Page

Because everything collapses into four layers:

1. Inquiry enters
2. Product-aligned deal moves
3. Service & warranty run
4. Performance is measured

Complex products, **simple system view**.
