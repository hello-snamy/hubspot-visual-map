Got it — I’ll **walk you through the complete one-page HubSpot map** like a systems diagram, not marketing fluff. Think of this as **“how HubSpot actually works when it’s set up correctly”**, all in one mental model.

---

## The Big Idea (30-second overview)

The one-page HubSpot map shows:

**How a person becomes revenue → how teams act → how results are measured**

Everything flows left → right and top → bottom:

1. **Where leads come from**
2. **How HubSpot stores truth**
3. **How revenue moves**
4. **How humans are triggered to act**
5. **How leadership sees reality**

---

## 1️⃣ Entry Points — Where Everything Starts

**Top-left of the map**

These are the *only* ways data should enter HubSpot:

### Inbound

* Forms
* Ads
* Chat
* Website tracking
* Content downloads

### Outbound

* Imports
* List uploads
* Manual creation
* API integrations

**Why this matters**
If data enters outside these paths, reporting breaks immediately.

> Rule: *Every contact must have a source.*

---

## 2️⃣ Core CRM Objects — System of Record

**Center-left of the map**

These are HubSpot’s “truth tables.”

### Contacts

* One row = one human
* Holds lifecycle stage, lead score, owner

### Companies

* Auto-associated or manually linked
* Used for B2B reporting and enrichment

### Deals

* Revenue containers
* Never created “just in case”

### Tickets

* Post-sale truth
* Support, onboarding, success

**Why this matters**
Everything else (automation, dashboards) reads from these objects.

> Rule: *If it’s not on an object, it doesn’t exist.*

---

## 3️⃣ Pipelines — How Work Progresses

**Center of the map**

Pipelines show **status**, not activity.

### Sales Pipeline

Typical stages:

* Lead / Prospect
* Qualified
* Demo
* Proposal
* Closed Won / Lost

### Secondary Pipelines

* Renewals
* Upsell / Expansion
* Onboarding (optional)
* Support (Tickets)

**Why this matters**
Each pipeline:

* Has one owner
* Has one goal
* Feeds one dashboard

> Rule: *If it forecasts money, it must be a Deal pipeline.*

---

## 4️⃣ Sequences — Human Action Engine

**Right of pipelines**

Sequences = **structured human outreach**.

Used for:

* SDR outbound
* Demo follow-ups
* Re-engagement
* Renewal nudges

Key traits:

* Time-based
* Task + email mix
* Stops on reply

**Why this matters**
Automation creates opportunity — **sequences create motion**.

> Rule: *Automation assigns, humans close.*

---

## 5️⃣ Automation & Rules — The Invisible Backbone

**Under everything (horizontal layer)**

This is the most important part of the map.

### Lead Scoring

* Behavioral (page views, forms)
* Demographic (role, company size)

### Lifecycle Stage Automation

* Subscriber → Lead → MQL → SQL → Customer

### Deal Stage Automation

* Stage change → tasks → notifications

### Routing Rules

* Territory
* Account ownership
* Round robin

**Why this matters**
Order matters. Bad ordering = chaos.

Correct order:

1. Score
2. Classify
3. Route
4. Notify
5. Measure

> Rule: *Sales should never think about admin.*

---

## 6️⃣ Dashboards — Executive Truth Layer

**Far right / bottom**

Dashboards don’t run the system — they **reflect it**.

### Marketing Dashboard

* Lead volume
* Conversion rates
* Source quality

### Sales Dashboard

* Pipeline value
* Stage velocity
* Win rate

### RevOps / Funnel Dashboard

* Lifecycle flow
* Leakage points
* Time to close

### Support Dashboard

* Ticket volume
* SLA
* CSAT

**Why this matters**
If dashboards look wrong, the problem is upstream — not the chart.

> Rule: *Dashboards never fix data. They expose it.*

---

## 7️⃣ How It All Connects (Mental Model)

Here’s the full loop in plain English:

> Someone enters HubSpot →
> Becomes a Contact →
> Is scored + classified →
> Gets routed →
> A Deal is created →
> Humans act via Sequences →
> Deal moves stages →
> Revenue closes →
> Tickets support →
> Dashboards tell leadership what to fix

That’s the **entire system**.

---

## 8️⃣ Why This Fits on One Page

Because HubSpot only has **four real layers**:

1. **Data in**
2. **Data stored**
3. **Work moves**
4. **Results shown**

Everything else is detail.

---

## 9️⃣ What This Map Is Used For

This one-page map is perfect for:

* Onboarding new hires
* Auditing broken portals
* Aligning Sales + Marketing + Ops
* Explaining HubSpot to execs
* Deciding what *not* to automate

---

If you want, next I can:

* Annotate the map with **who owns what**
* Show **where HubSpot portals usually break**
* Create a **printable version**
* Add **PLG or enterprise variations**
* Translate it into **actual HubSpot workflows**

Just tell me the angle you want next.
