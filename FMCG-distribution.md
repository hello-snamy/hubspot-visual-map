Perfect — FMCG distribution is *high-volume, fast-moving, margin-sensitive*, so HubSpot has to act like an **execution engine**, not a fancy CRM. I’ll explain the **complete one-page HubSpot map specifically for an FMCG distribution company** (manufacturer-led distribution, super-stockist, distributor, or large channel partner).

Think: **retailer → order → fulfillment → payment → repeat cycle**.

---

## The FMCG Distribution Reality (Why HubSpot Needs Discipline)

FMCG distributors deal with:

* Thousands of retailers
* Frequent repeat orders
* Sales reps in the field
* Price lists, schemes, credit limits
* Tight working capital

So your HubSpot map must prioritize:

* Speed
* Accuracy
* Territory ownership
* Visibility of orders & collections

---

## 1️⃣ Entry Points — How FMCG Leads & Orders Enter

**Top-left of the map**

### Inbound

* Retailer onboarding forms
* WhatsApp / call center inquiries
* Trade marketing campaigns
* Distributor / sub-distributor referrals

### Outbound

* Field sales rep onboarding
* Outlet mapping
* Beat planning imports

**Critical FMCG data captured immediately**

* Outlet type (kirana, supermarket, HORECA)
* Territory / beat
* Price tier
* Credit limit
* GST / tax info

> Rule: If territory isn’t captured, execution breaks.

## 2️⃣ Core CRM Objects — FMCG System of Record

**Center-left**

### Contacts

* Store owner / manager
* Purchase decision-maker

### Companies (Very Important)

In FMCG, **Company = outlet**.

Company properties:

* Outlet classification
* Territory
* Distributor assigned
* Credit terms
* Scheme eligibility

---

### Deals (Orders, Not Just Sales)

For FMCG, **Deals = orders**.

Each deal represents:

* One order cycle (daily / weekly / monthly)

> Rule: Never mix long-term relationships with order transactions.

---

### Custom Objects (Highly Recommended)

* **Products / SKUs**
* **Price Lists**
* **Schemes / Promotions**
* **Collections / Payments**

Without these, HubSpot becomes unusable at scale.

## 3️⃣ Pipelines — High-Velocity Order Flow

**Center of the map**

### Order Pipeline

Typical stages:

1. Order Placed
2. Approved (Credit / Pricing)
3. Picked & Packed
4. Dispatched
5. Delivered
6. Invoiced
7. Closed Won / Lost

---

### Retailer Onboarding Pipeline

Stages:

1. New Outlet
2. Verification
3. Credit Approved
4. Active Retailer

---

### Collections Pipeline (Optional but Powerful)

Tracks:

* Outstanding payments
* Overdue invoices
* Follow-ups

> Rule: Sales and collections must be visible together.

---

## 4️⃣ Sequences — Sales Rep Execution Layer

**Right side**

Sequences are **rep playbooks**, not email blasts.

### Retailer Sequences

* New outlet onboarding
* Scheme announcements
* Order reminders
* Re-order nudges

### Collections Sequences

* Payment reminders
* Overdue escalation
* Relationship-safe follow-ups

**Golden rule**

> FMCG automation supports reps in the field — it never slows them down.

---

## 5️⃣ Automation & Rules — Controlling Chaos

**Under everything**

### Retailer Scoring

Score outlets based on:

* Order frequency
* Average order value
* Payment behavior
* SKU coverage

---

### Lifecycle Stages (FMCG-Specific)

Prospect Outlet
→ Onboarded Outlet
→ **Active Retailer**
→ Key Account
→ Dormant
→ Lost Outlet

---

### Routing Rules

* Territory-based assignment
* Beat ownership
* Distributor mapping

---

### Deal Automation

* Order created → stock check
* Credit limit exceeded → approval task
* Delivered → invoice + payment follow-up

> Rule: No manual approvals without visibility.

---

## 6️⃣ Dashboards — What FMCG Leaders Actually Need

**Right / bottom**

### Sales Rep Dashboard

* Today’s orders
* Missed outlets
* Beat performance

### Distributor / ASM Dashboard

* Orders by territory
* Scheme effectiveness
* Stock movement

### Finance Dashboard

* Outstanding receivables
* Credit utilization
* Aging analysis

### Management Dashboard

* Daily sales run rate
* Outlet coverage
* SKU-wise performance

---

## 7️⃣ The Full FMCG Loop (Plain English)

> A retailer is onboarded →
> Sales rep takes orders →
> Orders are approved →
> Goods dispatched →
> Delivered →
> Invoiced →
> Payment collected →
> Next order cycle begins

That’s the **FMCG engine**.

---

## 8️⃣ Why the One-Page Map Is Critical in FMCG

FMCG breaks when:

* Reps miss outlets
* Credit isn’t controlled
* Schemes aren’t tracked
* Collections lag sales
* Management reacts too late

This map enforces:

* Daily execution
* Territory discipline
* Cash-flow control
* Predictable growth

---

## 9️⃣ Common FMCG HubSpot Mistakes

❌ Using HubSpot like Salesforce CRM
❌ No outlet hierarchy
❌ No credit visibility
❌ Schemes tracked in Excel
❌ Dashboards built monthly instead of daily

---

## 10️⃣ Why This Still Fits on One Page

Because it’s still the same four layers:

1. Outlet enters
2. Order moves
3. Fulfillment + payment happen
4. Performance is measured

The volume is high — the logic stays simple.
